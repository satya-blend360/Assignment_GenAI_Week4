## 🚀 Scalability Challenge: Handling 100GB+ Sales Data

When the dataset grows to **100GB or more**, a local CSV + Pandas approach is no longer feasible. The system is redesigned using **cloud-native big data and AI retrieval patterns**.

---

### 📥 Data Preprocessing

* Store raw files in **cloud object storage** (Google Cloud Storage / AWS S3)
* Use **Apache Spark** for distributed preprocessing:

  * Data cleaning & validation
  * Partitioning by `Year`, `Month`, `Region`
  * Aggregation of daily and monthly metrics
* Save processed data in **Parquet / Delta format** for efficient reads

---

### 🗄️ Data Storage & Indexing

* Load processed data into **BigQuery / Snowflake**
* Use:

  * **Partitioned tables** (by date)
  * **Clustered columns** (state, category)
* Create:

  * Aggregated fact tables (revenue, orders, cancellations)
  * Dimensional tables (product, geography)

---

### 🔍 Efficient Data Retrieval

* Use **SQL-based aggregation** for structured queries
* Use **LangChain + Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:

  * Convert summaries into embeddings
  * Store embeddings in **FAISS / Pinecone**
* Retrieval Flow:

```
User Query → Intent Detection
          → SQL / Vector Search
          → Relevant Summary
          → Gemini AI Response
```

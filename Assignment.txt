Retail Insights Assistant

Goal:
    Create a GenAI chatbot or summarizer that answers business questions about the sales dataset.

Tasks:
    Use Gemini API (or OpenAI API / LangChain) for natural language understanding.

    Input: Sales summary or CSV file.

Output:
    Summary report, or Answers to user questions (e.g., “Which region performed best in Q3?”).
    Add a prompt-engineering layer for consistency.

Scalability Challenge:
    Propose an approach when the data grows to 100GB —
    How will you preprocess, store, and index it?
    How will you retrieve relevant data efficiently?
    Which cloud or big data tools will you use?

Tech: Python, Gemini API / OpenAI API / LangChain, Streamlit (optional UI)

Deliverables: Chatbot or summarization script + screenshots (chat interface, example responses, summary text) + architecture/approach for 100GB data
